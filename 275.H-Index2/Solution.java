// Follow up for H-Index: 
// Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

// For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

// Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

// Hint:

// An easy approach is to sort the array first.
// What are the possible values of h-index?
// A faster approach is to use extra space.

//What if the citations array is sorted in ascending order? Could you optimize your algorithm?

// Hint:

// Expected runtime complexity is in O(log n) and the input is sorted.
